NetDoor is a remote door access control system that connects to ZKTeco door devices via the TCP/IP protocol. It utilizes the open-source Standalone SDK to enable one-click remote door unlocking from a computer. Each department within a company will only have access to its own assigned device, ensuring security and user management. The system will provide an intuitive interface compatible with all ZKTeco devices that support the Standalone SDK.
